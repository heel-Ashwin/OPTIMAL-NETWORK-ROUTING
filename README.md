# OPTIMAL-NETWORK-ROUTING
Network Planning Tool
This Python script provides a network planning tool that assists in the design and configuration of computer networks. It allows users to analyze project feasibility, create network topologies, select equipment, configure security measures, and generate monitoring tool configurations.

# Features:
*Feasibility analysis to determine project viability.*
*Creation of various network topologies such as star, mesh, bus, and ring.*
*Selection of network equipment based on user-defined specifications.*
*Configuration of security measures including firewalls, encryption, and ACLs.*
*Generation of monitoring tool configurations for network devices.*
*Utilization of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in the network topology.*

# Getting Started
  # Prerequisites
  *Python 3.x*
  *NetworkX library (install via pip install networkx)*
  *Matplotlib library (install via pip install matplotlib)*
